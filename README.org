* Singularity Vim color scheme

This is a fork of [[https://github.com/dracula/vim][the Dracula color scheme for Vim]].

I need to host this on a seperate repository for compatibility with plugin managers.

The rest of the Singularity themes as well as information on them can be found [[https://github.com/joznia/singularity][here]].
